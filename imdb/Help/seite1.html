<p>
Enter keywords/tags and press search button to get respective images. The annotations were assigned manually to the pictures in the database.
</p><br>
<h3>Search by Image</h3>

You can upload a image and search for similar images by clicking on search button.<br>

By default, Google inception-v3 algorithm is used for feature extraction and cosine is used for distance computation.<br>

User can play with the advanced search by changing the feature extraction algorithms, distance algorithms and number of clusters.<br><br>
<h4>Feature algorithm</h4>
<p>There are three feature extraction algorithms:<br>
1. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/inception-v3-advanced">Inception-v3</a><br>
2. <a href="https://neurohive.io/en/popular-networks/vgg16/">VGG 16</a><br>
3. <a href="https://orangedatamining.com/widget-catalog/image-analytics/imageembedding/">VGG 19</a><br><br>
Number of clusters slider can be used to filter results as per accuracy. The more the number of clusters, better the accuracy and fewer results.<br><br>
</p></p>

<h4>Distance algorithm</h4>
<p>User can select distance algorithms like Euclidean and cosine distance where
cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar images are far apart by the Euclidean distance because of the features(Image embedding), colour, Size etc.</p>
